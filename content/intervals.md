## **What Are Intervals?**

An **interval** is the distance between two pitches, measured by:

- **Semitones** (half steps)
- **Letter names** (scale degrees)

Intervals can be:

- **Melodic**: Played sequentially (e.g., C → D in a melody).
- **Harmonic**: Played simultaneously (e.g., C and E in a chord).

## **Types of Intervals**

### **1. By Size**

| Interval Name | Semitones | Example (C as root) | Quality |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Unison | 0 | C → C | Perfect |
| Minor Second | 1 | C → D♭ | Diminished |
| Major Second | 2 | C → D | Major |
| Minor Third | 3 | C → E♭ | Minor |
| Major Third | 4 | C → E | Major |
| Perfect Fourth | 5 | C → F | Perfect |
| Tritone | 6 | C → F♯/G♭ | Augmented/Diminished |
| Perfect Fifth | 7 | C → G | Perfect |
| Minor Sixth | 8 | C → A♭ | Minor |
| Major Sixth | 9 | C → A | Major |
| Minor Seventh | 10 | C → B♭ | Minor |
| Major Seventh | 11 | C → B | Major |
| Octave | 12 | C → C′ | Perfect |

### **2. By Complexity**

- **Simple Intervals**: Span ≤ 1 octave (e.g., major third).
- **Compound Intervals**: Span > 1 octave (e.g., major 10th = octave + major third).

## **Interval Qualities**

- **Perfect**: Unison, 4th, 5th, octave (stable, consonant).
- **Major/Minor**: 2nds, 3rds, 6ths, 7ths (major = brighter, minor = darker).
- **Augmented/Diminished**: Altered by a semitone (e.g., C→F♯ = augmented 4th; C→G♭ = diminished 5th).

---

## **Consonant vs. Dissonant Intervals**

| Consonant (Stable) | Dissonant (Unstable) |
| :-- | :-- |
| Perfect Unison, 4th, 5th, octave | Minor 2nd, Major 7th |
| Major/Minor 3rd, 6th | Tritone (augmented 4th/diminished 5th) |
|  | Major 2nd, Minor 7th |

**Note**: Context matters! In jazz, dissonance (e.g., tritones) is embraced for tension; in classical, it often resolves.

## **Enharmonic Intervals**

Same semitones, different names:

- **C→F♯** = augmented 4th (6 semitones).
- **C→G♭** = diminished 5th (6 semitones).

---

## **Key Applications**

1. **Melodies**:
    - Steps (e.g., C→D = major 2nd) create smooth motion.
    - Leaps (e.g., C→E = major 3rd) add drama.
2. **Chords**:
    - Major/minor triads = root + 3rd + 5th.
    - Dominant 7th chords = root + 3rd + 5th + minor 7th.
3. **Harmony**:
    - Perfect 5ths anchor cadences (e.g., V→I).
    - Tritones resolve inward (e.g., B→F resolves to C→E).

## **Interval Inversions**

Flip the notes to create a new interval:

- **Major 3rd** (C→E) → **Minor 6th** (E→C).
- **Perfect 4th** (C→F) → **Perfect 5th** (F→C).
