# Lydian Mode

## Introduction

Lydian mode is a mode which is derived from the major scale with a raised fourth scale degree, which gives it a distinct sound. The formula for the Lydian mode is:

`1, 2, 3, #4, 5, 6, 7`

Each mode has its own unique formula of intervals (whole and half steps). For any given root note, we can apply the formula to create each of the seven modes for that root. The Lydian mode has the following interval formula:

* Root
* Major second
* Major third
* Augmented fourth
* Perfect fifth
* Major sixth
* Major seventhd

In other words, the interval formula is `WWWHWWH`.

## Constructing Lydian Mode

The fourth note of the major scale as root note is Lydian.

### **Diatonic Triads in Lydian Mode**

| Degree | Chord Type | Example C Lydian (C - D - E - F# - G - A - B) | Notes in the Example C Lydian |
| ------ | ---------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| I      | Major      | C                                             | C - E - G                     |
| II     | Major      | D                                             | D - F# - A                    |
| III    | Minor      | Em                                            | E - G - B                     |
| IV     | Diminished | F#dim                                         | F# - A - C                    |
| V      | Major      | G                                             | G - B - D                     |
| VI     | Minor      | Am                                            | A - C - E                     |
| VII    | Minor      | Bm                                            | B - D - F#                    |

### **Diatonic 7th Chords in Lydian Mode**

| Degree | Chord Type                   | Example (C Lydian) | Notes          |
| ------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| I      | Major 7 (#11)                | Cmaj7#11           | C - E - G - B  |
| II     | Dominant 7                   | D7                 | D - F# - A - C |
| III    | Minor 7                      | Em7                | E - G - B - D  |
| IV     | Minor 7♭5 (Half-Diminished) | F#m7♭5            | F# - A - C - E |
| V      | Major 7                      | Gmaj7              | G - B - D - F# |
| VI     | Minor 7                      | Am7                | A - C - E - G  |
| VII    | Minor 7                      | Bm7                | B - D - F# - A |

## **Common Lydian Chord Progressions**

* **I-II Progression**:

  * **C - D** (in C Lydian): This progression emphasizes the major chords and creates a bright, uplifting feel. The D major chord includes the sharp fourth scale degree, which is characteristic of the Lydian mode.
* **I-II-III Progression**:

  * **C - D - Em** (in C Lydian): This progression adds a minor chord to create contrast and depth. The Em chord shares notes with the C major chord, maintaining the Lydian sound.
* **I-V Progression with Suspended Chords**:

  * **C - Csus2 - G** (in C Lydian): Using suspended chords adds tension and release, fitting well with the Lydian mode's open feel.
* **I-IV-V Progression (Altered for Lydian)**:

  * **C - F#dim - G** (in C Lydian): This progression uses the diminished IV chord to create tension before resolving to the major V chord.
* **vi-IV-I-V Progression (Inspired by Common Modal Progressions)**:

  * **Am - F#dim - C - G** (in C Lydian): This progression cycles through different modes (minor, Lydian, major, Mixolydian), creating a dynamic emotional journey.

When using 7th chords in the Lydian mode, the chord progressions can be similar to those with triads, but with additional complexity due to the extra note.
