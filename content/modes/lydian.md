## Introduction

The **Lydian mode** is a mode which is derived from the major scale with a **raised fourth (4#)** scale degree, which gives it a distinct sound.

## Structure of the Mixolydian Mode

The Lydian mode is the **fourth mode** of the major scale. Its formula is:

**1, 2, 3, #4, 5, 6, 7**

Each mode has its own unique formula of intervals (whole and half steps). For any given root note, we can apply the formula to create each of the seven modes for that root. The Lydian mode has the following interval formula:

- **Intervals**:

* Root
* Major 2nd
* Major 3rd
* Augmented 4th (#4)
* Perfect 5th
* Major 6th
* Major 7th

In other words, the interval formula is **W – W - W - H - W - W - H** (Whole and half steps).

#### Example:

Notes of the C Lydian Scale: C – D – E – F# – G – A – B – C


## Lydian in Action

#### Iconic Examples:

1. **"Flying in a Blue Dream" by Joe Satriani**
   * This instrumental track is often cited as a classic example of the Lydian mode in rock music, showcasing its bright and expansive sound.
2. **"Dreams" by Fleetwood Mac**
   * From their iconic album "Rumours," this song subtly incorporates the Lydian mode to create an ethereal atmosphere, enhancing its emotional depth.
3. **"Freewill" by Rush**
   * This progressive rock song features sections that utilize the Lydian mode, contributing to its complex and dynamic structure.

## Constructing Lydian Mode

The fourth note of the major scale as root note is Lydian.

## Common Lydian Chord Progressions

* **I-II Progression**:

  * **C - D** (in C Lydian): This progression emphasizes the major chords and creates a bright, uplifting feel. The D major chord includes the sharp fourth scale degree, which is characteristic of the Lydian mode.
* **I-II-III Progression**:

  * **C - D - Em** (in C Lydian): This progression adds a minor chord to create contrast and depth. The Em chord shares notes with the C major chord, maintaining the Lydian sound.
* **I-V Progression with Suspended Chords**:

  * **C - Csus2 - G** (in C Lydian): Using suspended chords adds tension and release, fitting well with the Lydian mode's open feel.
* **I-IV-V Progression (Altered for Lydian)**:

  * **C - F#dim - G** (in C Lydian): This progression uses the diminished IV chord to create tension before resolving to the major V chord.
* **vi-IV-I-V Progression (Inspired by Common Modal Progressions)**:

  * **Am - F#dim - C - G** (in C Lydian): This progression cycles through different modes (minor, Lydian, major, Mixolydian), creating a dynamic emotional journey.

When using 7th chords in the Lydian mode, the chord progressions can be similar to those with triads, but with additional complexity due to the extra note.
