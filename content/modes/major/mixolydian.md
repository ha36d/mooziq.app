## Introduction

The **Mixolydian mode** is a famous musical mode in genres like blues, rock, and folk, offering a major scale sound with a **flattened seventh (♭7)**. This subtle alteration creates a distinct "dominant" vibe, blending brightness with a touch of tension.

## Structure of the Mixolydian Mode

The Mixolydian mode is the **fifth mode** of the major scale. Its formula is:  
**1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ♭7**

Each mode has its own unique formula of intervals (whole and half steps). For any given root note, we can apply the formula to create each of the seven modes for that root.

#### Intervals:

- Root  
- Major 2nd  
- Major 3rd  
- Perfect 4th  
- Perfect 5th  
- Major 6th  
- Minor 7th (♭7)

**Interval formula**: **W – W – H – W – W – H – W**

#### Example:

C Mixolydian Scale: C – D – E – F – G – A – B♭ – C

#### Formula Comparison:

| Mode           | Formula (Relative to Major) | Example (C)     |
|----------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|
| **Ionian**     | 1-2-3-4-5-6-7               | C-D-E-F-G-A-B   |
| **Mixolydian** | 1-2-3-4-5-6-♭7             | C-D-E-F-G-A-B♭  |
