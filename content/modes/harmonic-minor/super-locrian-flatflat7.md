## Introduction

**Super Locrian ♭♭7** is the **seventh mode** of the Harmonic Minor scale. It is even more dissonant than the standard Super Locrian from Melodic Minor due to its **doubly flatted 7th** — creating intense chromaticism ideal for advanced jazz and avant-garde harmony.

## Structure

**Formula**: 1, ♭2, ♭3, ♭4, ♭5, ♭6, ♭♭7 (same as 6)  
**Interval formula**: H – H – H – H – H – H – W

### Example:

G♯ Super Locrian ♭♭7 (from A Harmonic Minor):  
G♯ – A – B – C – D – E – F
