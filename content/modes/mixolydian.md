## Introduction
The **Mixolydian mode** is a famous musical mode in genres like blues, rock, and folk, offering a major scale sound with a **flattened seventh (♭7)**. This subtle alteration creates a distinct "dominant" vibe, blending brightness with a touch of tension.

## Structure of the Mixolydian Mode
The Mixolydian mode is the **fifth mode** of the major scale. Its formula is:

**1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ♭7**

Each mode has its own unique formula of intervals (whole and half steps). For any given root note, we can apply the formula to create each of the seven modes for that root.

#### Intervals:
* Root
* Major 2nd
* Major 3rd
* Perfect 4th
* Perfect 5th
* Major 6th
* Minor 7th (♭7)

Interval formula: **W – W – H – W – W – H – W**

#### Example:
C Mixolydian Scale: C – D – E – F – G – A – B♭ – C

#### Formula Comparison:
| Mode           | Formula (Relative to Major) | Example (C)     |
| -------------- | --------------------------- | --------------- |
| **Ionian**     | 1-2-3-4-5-6-7               | C-D-E-F-G-A-B   |
| **Mixolydian** | 1-2-3-4-5-6-♭7             | C-D-E-F-G-A-B♭ |

## Mixolydian in Action

#### Iconic Examples:
1. **"Sweet Child O’ Mine" (Guns N’ Roses)** – Uses D Mixolydian in the main riff.
2. **"Scarborough Fair" (Traditional Folk)** – Melody leans on Mixolydian’s ♭7.
3. **"All Blues" (Miles Davis)** – Jazz classic with a Mixolydian backbone.

## Why Use Mixolydian?

* **Dominant Harmony**: The ♭7 creates a **dominant 7th chord** (e.g., G7 in G Mixolydian), ideal for blues and rock progressions.
* **Bluesy Flexibility**: Balances major-scale brightness with minor-like tension.
* **No Leading Tone**: The ♭7 avoids the strong resolution of the major scale, lending a "laid-back" feel.

## FAQ

### Why the ♭7?

It replaces the major scale’s leading tone (B in C major), creating a "hang in mid-air" tension perfect for blues and rock.

### Is Mixolydian major or minor?

**Major** — because of the major 3rd — but the ♭7 adds a hybrid, bluesy feel.

### How to practice?

* Improvise over looped dominant chords.
* Emphasize the ♭7.
* Blend with pentatonic scales.
